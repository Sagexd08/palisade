"""Anthropic (Claude) adapter for the judgment layer.

Claude's Messages API is not OpenAI-shaped, so it gets its own adapter
rather than being forced through the generic one. The question spec, the
strict-JSON contract and the schema validation are shared with
`openai_compatible`, so a reply that does not match the schema is an error
here too, never a guess.

Like every bring-your-own-endpoint backend, answers are `verified=False`:
they are advisory and can never BLOCK on judgment alone. Only the
calibrated TypeSafe service is treated as verified.
