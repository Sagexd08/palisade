"""The launch surfaces may not publish precision without recall.

This is the rule that took three measurements to earn. Precision 1.000 over
40,466 files is true and, quoted alone, it is an advertisement for a scanner
that finds almost nothing: a tool that reports nothing has perfect precision for
free. Held-out recall is 0.000 over 45 independent observations, and a reader
who sees one number without the other has been misled by omission.

Prose has no tests, which is how ten places came to quote a recall figure
measured on the engine's own training material for months. So the rule is
mechanical here: any user-facing surface that states the precision claim must
state the held-out figure too, with its denominator.

Scoped to the surfaces a user or a model actually reads. The CHANGELOG is
excluded: it is a record of what was true at each release, and rewriting history
to satisfy a present-day rule would be the opposite of honest.
